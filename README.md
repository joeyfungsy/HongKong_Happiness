# Hong Kong Happiness Report 2021

## Introduction

The year of 2020 was a remarkably difficult year to the whole world. I am interested in knowing how people are feeling in 2021: Are they feeling happier as they are slowly recovering from the panadmic? Or are people still feeling worry about COVID-19? As a HongKonger, I would love to see how happy people in Hong Kong are feeling as for 2021 after experiencing the pandamics. 

## Abstract

In this project, The goal of this project is to visualize and report the happieness index and its score components of Hong Kong and compare them with its surrounding neighbors in East Asia. I would like to know how and what differences causing HongKongers feel comparing to citizens in the neighborhood, sharing the similar Asian cultures, environment and weather. 

The features that will be included in this project as meansurements are:
- Ladder score: scales from 1 to 10. 10 means the best and 0 means the worst.
- Log GDP per capita: how much economic production value can be attrubuted to each individual citizen i.e. a measure of national wealth of market value per person
- Social support: national aveage of binary responses (yes/no) based on Gallup World Poll questions about neighbours, friends, family and social support
- Healthy Life Expectancy at birth: the average life in good health
- Freedom to make life choices: national aveage of binary responses (yes/no) based on Gallup World Poll questions about individuals' oppportunites and autonomy to perform an action

I use python to analyse data and perform visualization in this report, including libraries e.g. pandas, numpy, plotly and matplotlib.
