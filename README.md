# Hong Kong Happiness Report 2021

## Introduction

The year 2020 was a remarkably difficult year for the whole world. I am interested in knowing how people are feeling in 2021: Are they feeling happier as they are slowly recovering from the pandemic? Or are people still feeling worried about COVID-19? As a Hongkonger, I would love to see how happy people in Hong Kong are feeling for 2021 after experiencing the pandemics. 

## Abstract

In this project, The goal of this project is to visualize and report the happiness index and its score components of Hong Kong and compare them with its surrounding neighbors in East Asia. I would like to know how and what differences causing Hongkongers to feel comparing to citizens in the neighborhood, sharing similar Asian cultures, environments, and weather. 

The features that will be included in this project as measurements are:
- Ladder score: scales from 1 to 10. 10 means the best and 0 means the worst.
- Log GDP per capita: how much economic production value can be attributed to each citizen i.e. a measure of the national wealth of market value per person
- Social support: national average of binary responses (yes/no) based on Gallup World Poll questions about neighbors, friends, family, and social support
- Healthy Life Expectancy at birth: the average life in good health
- Freedom to make life choices: national average of binary responses (yes/no) based on Gallup World Poll questions about individuals' opportunities and autonomy to perform an action

I use python to analyze data and perform visualization in this report, including libraries e.g. pandas, NumPy, plotly, and matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The happiness ranking and scores use data from the Gallup World Poll. The 2021 report contains 149 countries.
