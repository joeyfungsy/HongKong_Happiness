# Hong Kong Happiness Report 2021

## Introduction

The year of 2020 was a remarkably difficult year to the whole world. I am interested in knowing how people are feeling in 2021: Are they feeling happier as they are slowly recovering from the panadmic? Or are people still feeling worry about COVID-19? As a HongKonger, I would love to see how happy people in Hong Kong are feeling as for 2021 after experiencing the pandamics. 

In this project, The goal of this project is to visualize and report the happieness index and its score components of Hong Kong and compare them with its surrounding neighbors in East Asia.
