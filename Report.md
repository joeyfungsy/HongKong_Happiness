# Hong Kong Happiness Report 2021
Sharing a report of the analyze I made and the data visualization I built 


## Overview 
A world map view of the ladder score (happiness score) by countries in 2021. Countries that have a higher than average score are marked in green otherwise in red (gray indicates that the areas are undefined yet). From the map, we can quickly identify that countries in the Europe, America and Oceania continents are mostly green, such as the United States,Italy and Australia. Most of the countries in Africa continents are in red. Generally, people lives in a well developed countries are happier than in a less developed countries.

The ladder score is scaled from 0 to 10. 
The mean of ladder score of the world: 5.53 and the mean of the East Asia Country: 5.81
The country in the world that has the highest ladder score (index): Finland. The difference between the mean and its ladder score is: 2.31.
The country in the world that has the lowest ladder score (index): Afghanistan. The difference between the mean and its ladder score is: 3.01.

A box plot of the ladder score can provide us a visual summary of the dataset. The box in the box plot is slightly towards the left, which gaves us a "skewed to the right" distribution on a histogram (distribution). The longer tail on the right may cause by a few extreme values on the right i.e. some countries has a sigificantly lower ladder score.
