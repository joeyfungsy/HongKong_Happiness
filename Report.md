# Is Hong Kong a happy place? (as for 2020)

## Introduction
The year 2020 was a remarkably difficult year for the whole world. As a Hongkonger, I would love to see how happy people in Hong Kong are feeling in 2020 after experiencing the pandemics. The dataset provided by the Gallup World Poll ranks the happiness of countries based on 6 key factors, which are economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. In this report, we will focus on the first 4 factors. We will compare the data of Hong Kong and its neighboring countries in East Asia with a similar culture and environment, and show the changes of some factors over time. 

## Overview 
A world map view of the ladder score (happiness score) by countries in 2021. Countries that have a higher than average score are marked in green otherwise in red (gray indicates that the areas are undefined yet). From the map, we can quickly identify that countries in the Europe, America, and Oceania continents are mostly green, such as the United States, Italy, and Australia. Most of the countries in Africa's continents are in red. Generally, people who live in well-developed countries are happier than in less developed countries.

The ladder score is on a scale of 0 to 10. 
The mean ladder score of the world: 5.53 and the mean of the East Asia Country: 5.81
The country in the world that has the highest ladder score (index): Finland. The difference between the mean and its ladder score is 2.31.
The country in the world that has the lowest ladder score (index): Afghanistan. The difference between the mean and its ladder score is 3.01.

A box plot of the ladder score can provide us a visual summary of the dataset. The box in the box plot is slightly towards the left, which gives us a "skewed to the right" distribution on a histogram (distribution). The long tail on the right may cause by a few extreme values on the right i.e. some countries has a significantly lower ladder score.

## Hong Kong VS Other East Asian Countries
We compare the ladder score and other side components of Hong Kong with the other 5 East Asian countries, which are Taiwan Province of China, Japan, South Korea, China, and Mongolia. 

### Ladder Score Ranking 
The country in East Asia that has the highest ladder score (index): Taiwan Province of China. The difference between the mean and its ladder score (East Asia only) is 0.77. The country in East Asia that has the lowest ladder score (index): China. The difference between the mean and its ladder score (East Asia only) is 0.47. 

This box plot of the ladder score only contains the summary of East Asian Countries. The average ladder score of East Asian Countries is 5.76 and the mean is 5.81.

Hong Kong has a 5.48/10 ladder score, which comes in 77th place in the world and 5th place among the 6 East-Asian Country. Its score is 0.05 less than the world's average and 0.33 less than the East Asia countries' average. It falls into the lower quartile in both of the box plots above.

### Economic Production Ranking
Hong Kong ranks 1st among the East Asian countries and the 8th worldwide (WOW, I didn't realize Hong Kong is the Top 10 in the world before)! Its GDP per capita is 11, which is higher than the average of both East Asia and globally.

### Freedom Ranking
The social support score is on a scale of 0 to 1. 1 has the most freedom. Hong Kong ranks 4th among the East Asian countries and 113th among 149 countries, falling below Pakistan and Russia.

Hong Kong scores 0.71 in 2021, down from 0.80 in 2016 and 0.91 in 2006. This shows that citizens of Hong Kong believe that they are losing their freedom to make life choices over years. I believe the recent political changes and protests have a close impact e.g. the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in 2019-2020 and the Mong Kok civil unrest in 2016.

### Conclusion
When we look at the overall breakdown of all the 6 key components in the life satisfaction score, we notice something interesting. Although Hong Kong does not rank the top of the ladder score, it has the highest overall score, mainly because of its strong economic production and health. There is still room for improvement in terms of social support and freedom to make life changes. If the Hong Kong government can provide more support on social support and give more freedom to citizens, e.g. medical care, housing, and voting, then Hong Kong's ladder score can be improved soon.
